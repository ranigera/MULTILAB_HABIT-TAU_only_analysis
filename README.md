This repository is only to include the analysis done specifically for the Tel Aviv sample (for the PhD thesis of Rani Gera) that was collected as part of the work for the following paper:
"Determining the effects of training duration on the behavioral expression of habitual control in humans: a multilaboratory investigation" by Pool et al. (2022)

The multilab data repo is at https://github.com/evapool/MULTILAB_HABIT
